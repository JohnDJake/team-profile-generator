## Installation

Run ```npm install``` in the root project directory to set up the required Node packages.



## Usage

Run ```node index.js``` and respond to the prompts. The team page will be saved in ```output/team.html```.



## Contributing

Feel free to fork/pull.

If you'd like to add other types of employees, they must extend the ```Employee``` class and be written in the same format as the existing employee classes. Make sure you also update the ```employeeRole``` ```switch``` statements in ```app.js``` with new ```case```s for the new employees.

If you have any other changes you'd like to suggest, I'm happy to take a look at the pull request.



## Tests

You can run ```npm test``` in the root directory to test the existing classes.
